# Ruby (Rails) service for Kubernetes on Wodby

Build and run Ruby (Rails) applications on Kubernetes with Wodby.

This repository defines the Wodby service manifests and operational
configuration for Ruby (Rails).

## Start with a boilerplate

Use one of the boilerplates exposed by this service to start with compatible
build configuration and Wodby CI:

- [Rails boilerplate](https://github.com/wodby/rails-boilerplate)

## Wodby stacks using this service

- [Rails application stack](https://github.com/wodby/stack-rails)

## Service overview

| Property | Manifest configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Service name | `rails` |
| Type | Application service |
| Inherits from | [`ruby`](https://github.com/wodby/service-ruby) with version constraint `^1.0.0` |
| Application build | Git source connection enabled; Dockerfile: `Dockerfile`; boilerplates: Rails boilerplate |
| Configuration | 1 configuration files, 1 generated or fixed tokens |
| Operations | 2 actions |

## Use this service

Use this service through [Rails application stack](https://github.com/wodby/stack-rails), or reference `rails` from a custom
Wodby stack.

A service is a reusable component and does not deploy by itself. The stack
defines its links, settings, versions, resources, and relationship to the rest
of the application.

## Background jobs

The `rails-sidekiq` derivative is selected by default. The standard Rails stack
also makes Valkey required and supplies its persistent connection through
`REDIS_URL`, which Sidekiq reads automatically. The component `REDIS_HOST`,
`REDIS_PORT`, and `REDIS_PASSWORD` variables remain available for applications
that configure their client explicitly.

## Maintain a custom version

1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit the service manifest and referenced files.
3. Import the repository as a [Git-backed service](https://wodby.com/docs/2.0/services/create/#create-a-git-backed-service).
4. Reference the service from a stack manifest.

Keep service, workload, container, endpoint, link, volume, config, and
derivative names stable unless dependent stacks and app-level overrides are
updated at the same time.

Validate the manifests with:

```bash
wodby service validate-manifest service.yml --org <org-id>
```

See the [service manifest reference](https://wodby.com/docs/2.0/services/template/) and the [managed services index](https://github.com/wodby/services).
